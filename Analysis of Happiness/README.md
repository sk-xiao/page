# STA-141B Final Project:

By Shan Jiang, Songkai Xiao, Jiahui Li.

Note: 
Our final project is in the "141B_final_project.ipynb" file. 

HOWEVER, we recommend you to read our html-version report([Analysis of Happiness](https://ucdsta141b.github.io/sta141b-proj--jiahui-li-shan-jiang-songkai-xiao/141B_final_project.html)), since the github can't support interactive plots well.

## Analysis of Happiness

### Motivation

Do you know which country is the happiest in the world?<br>

Do you know what's the secret of the happiness, nationally speaking?<br>

You want the answers? Follow us!

We are lucky enough to find a rank of global happiness in http://worldhappiness.report/, which motivates us to gain more insights into this interesting topic.  

Related Researches shows that happiness is increasingly important to both individuals and countries. Being happy is not just about feeling
good. Research shows that it also makes us healthier, more productive and nicer. Happiness is increasingly considered the proper measure of social progress and the goal of public policy.

And this project are motivated by these questions:

* Which countries and which regions have the highest happiness values?


* What elements does the happiness value of a country or a region depend on?  Whatâ€™s the relationship between these elements and the happiness value?


* Can these countries be separated into different groups? Are these groups __distinct__ from each other? If yes, what's the __characteristics__ of these groups?
